**Examples of what makes a good use case by characteristics of blockchain:**

1. Distributed ledger — There is a need to share data across multiple companies. A "company" could be any group divided by political, geographical or organization boundary that has it operating as its own entity.
2. Distributed — There is no central point of control or ownership. This also means there is no shared server. The idea is that writing to someone's database on a shared server is not acceptable or is inefficient.
3. Indelible ledger — There is a need for a permanent, indelible record of transactions.
4. Smart Contracts — Business rules and data used in transactions can be visible to multiple members.

*Note:* If data is only used by one organization than it is probably not a good use of blockchain.
